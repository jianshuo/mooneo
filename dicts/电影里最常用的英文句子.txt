Why do you ask?	8841
"Please	 please."	8838
That's what I'm talking about.	8835
How about this?	8832
Hit me.	8829
I would.	8796
Get off of me!	8795
She did.	8785
It's yours.	8785
Not good.	8782

Any questions?	8764
Something wrong?	8757
Alan.	8738

And then what?	8697
Let me in!	8693

Red.	8185
She's here.	8177
Here he is.	8173
Do it now!	8169
Don't look at me.	8163
None of your business.	8157
"Let's go	 let's go."	8147
Who told you that?	8147
I'm just saying.	8136
Mummy!	8134
Carry on.	8133
I can feel it.	8130
A...	8119
Don't be.	8102
"No	 I'm sorry."	8102
I'm not hungry.	8101
I saw it.	8093
"Oh	 baby."	8092
You lied to me.	8088
Anybody?	8088
Can you do that?	8086
What the hell are you talking about?	8083
God bless you.	8076
Gosh.	8076
Keep it.	8070
One moment.	8070
We're done.	8066

I don't want it.	8054
"Oh	 I know."	8052
What have I done?	8041
Good bye.	8030
Can you believe it?	8028
You look good.	8026
Stay calm.	8026
Dismissed.	8020
Do you remember?	8007
"Easy	 easy."	8004
That's not fair.	8000
Hank.	7998
Murder.	7992
It's funny.	7978
I'll call you back.	7968
Stop right there!	7961

I can do it.	7922
Major.	7917
You're back.	7917
Today?	7916
"Yeah	 you're right."	7911
"No	 it's fine."	7906
Naturally.	7905
Attack!	7889
Can I ask you something?	7889
Could be.	7886
They're gone.	7885
Joey!	7880
I want to go home.	7874
It's	7874
"Hi	 Mom."	7872
Charge!	7870
You can't do this.	7866
Your turn.	7865
I found it.	7863
Gotta go.	7862
You have no idea.	7856

"All right	 come on."	7821
Help yourself.	7820
Fuck that.	7818
What the fuck!	7815
We're almost there.	7806
Why would you do that?	7803
How is it?	7800
There we are.	7799
You stay here.	7778
"Yeah	 thanks."	7774
Jeff!	7764
English	7758
It's not fair.	7750
All clear.	7749
Fall back!	7747
Suit yourself.	7744

One more time.	7734
That's an order.	7721
Phil!	7718
Outside.	7718
HELLO.	7713
"No	 nothing."	7703
Hold still.	7702
Not a chance.	7697
I didn't do it.	7687
I thought so.	7683
"Thank you	 thank you."	7682
Put the gun down.	7675
Just one.	7674
Julie.	7663
"Hey	 what are you doing?"	7658
I dunno.	7654
Right this way.	7647
Take a seat.	7646
My mother.	7643
That's bullshit.	7640
It's complicated.	7625
Jesse.	7624
No worries.	7623
Karen.	7616
I DON'T KNOW.	7614
Nothin'.	7611
Inside.	7608
What the hell's going on?	7607
I can't help it.	7605
"What's up	 man?"	7600
What am I supposed to do?	7599
I'm very sorry.	7588
Molly.	7586
Hold!	7580
Ta-da!	7569
I was there.	7566
My baby!	7564
What are we going to do?	7562
What about her?	7561
Pick it up.	7560
You can go.	7559
We got it.	7558
Why should I?	7555
What are we doing?	7534
You hungry?	7532
Victor.	7528

Shhh.	7500
Who do you think you are?	7500
Don't leave me.	7500
HI.	7493
William.	7492
Ja.	7489
Yes or no?	7485
Get going.	7484
"Good morning	 sir."	7482
You're alive.	7472
How should I know?	7468
Fucking hell.	7467
This is bullshit.	7464
Do me a favor.	7460
Oof!	7460
What should we do?	7459
Take cover!	7459
Pleasure.	7458
Why's that?	7453
Me too!	7452
Do you know?	7447
Good God!	7447
"Hey	 wait a minute."	7446
What are they doing?	7432
I appreciate that.	7414
Rick.	7412
Possibly.	7410
How was it?	7401
Say what?	7396
You scared me.	7382
You understand me?	7374
How did it go?	7369
I don't know yet.	7367
I heard.	7366
Ohhh!	7361
That's not the point.	7351
I did not.	7350
She's...	7349
What a surprise.	7349
Is that...	7346
"Okay	 thank you."	7345
Somebody!	7344
I should go.	7339
Don't mention it.	7333
Delicious.	7331
"OK	 OK."	7331
Peace.	7326
Splendid.	7325
That's wonderful.	7324
Mwah.	7317
Who's he?	7310
Take him.	7308
Forget about it.	7303
Buddy.	7295
Happy New Year.	7292
I see it.	7292
"Go	 go	 go	 go!"	7283
Your father?	7278
I had no idea.	7278
"Oh	 crap."	7267
Don't you get it?	7264
Of course it is.	7263
Whoops.	7260
Weird.	7256
Katie.	7256
Good news.	7250
All the time.	7246
Still.	7237
Pretty good.	7237
You win.	7234
I'll see you tomorrow.	7233
Bastards!	7232
Who...	7229
I am not.	7224
"Hell	 yeah."	7218
Wh...	7218
Neither do I.	7217
"Hear	 hear."	7217
"Hi	 Dad."	7198
"Yes	 but..."	7197
Hiya.	7196
You bitch!	7194
We're fine.	7183
Beat it!	7179
Come again?	7179
Barry.	7178
I'll help you.	7177
Not quite.	7176
We made it.	7169
Get the fuck out of here.	7168
Fool!	7165
I'm impressed.	7165
"Oh	 that."	7161
What'd you say?	7158
It's possible.	7152
Is he dead?	7144
Hit it!	7141
Nothing at all.	7132
Look at them.	7130
That's what I said.	7130
"Oh	 Christ."	7127
"Yeah	 I did."	7126
Lily.	7123
They are.	7121
Look who's here.	7121
Stand down.	7120
And me.	7116
HUH?	7115

Ted.	7113
How you feeling?	7112
"Okay	 come on."	7111
Help us!	7103
What am I doing?	7100
It's no big deal.	7099
Continue.	7097
What do you want to do?	7087
What's all this?	7085
"I	 um..."	7081
Or not.	7080
I wish.	7074
For how long?	7073
What do you care?	7067
Please forgive me.	7058
Harder!	7057
He does.	7056
"Oh	 honey."	7056
"Well	 then."	7055
"Well	"	7055
Let's eat.	7052
Kind of.	7042
Let me ask you something.	7042
RIGHT.	7039
"No	 I haven't."	7038
Hold this.	7038
Do you copy?	7033
Get out of the car.	7030
I won!	7030
"Yeah	 but..."	7021
Yesterday.	7014
Tea?	7008
It's cold.	7004
You like that?	7003
Who else?	7002
I'll see what I can do.	6998
What are you up to?	6998
Just wait.	6987
Now go.	6986

Where you been?	6960
I can't remember.	6958
Probably not.	6956
Kiss me.	6955
It's a long story.	6953
"I don't know	 man."	6950
Oh my!	6946
Of course you do.	6946
One more thing.	6945
"Okay	 here we go."	6941
Take that!	6941
Kelly.	6933
"I know	 right?"	6930
I said no.	6918
Is he okay?	6912
Tim.	6909
Not this time.	6909
Blood.	6908
What took you so long?	6905
That's awesome.	6905
Who said that?	6904
I hear you.	6897
I love him.	6895
Who the fuck are you?	6892
I had to.	6891
Are you happy?	6888
Upstairs.	6886
"All right	 fine."	6884
Watch your step.	6871
I didn't mean to.	6852
Nurse!	6848
What are they?	6847
My goodness.	6847
You can do this.	6844
It's not true.	6843
Marcus.	6836
It happens.	6832
Are you coming?	6830
I was just...	6827
Please sit down.	6826
Hot.	6820
You look beautiful.	6819
Does it hurt?	6819

Nice work.	6736
Mayday!	6734

What's the point?	6726
Is he?	6720
Cute.	6719
Take him away.	6705
It's up to you.	6705
Do it again.	6692
Sweetie.	6687
"Oh	 nothing."	6681
Don't be stupid.	6678
Beth.	6674

"Hey	 what's up?"	6657
So that's it?	6655
Roy!	6648
My brother.	6644
"Hey	 listen."	6641
Where did he go?	6640
I don't know anything.	6640
It's too dangerous.	6631
Did you know that?	6628
"Okay	 you know what?"	6620
Did you hear me?	6614
What were you thinking?	6614
Be my guest.	6612
It's crazy.	6611
Where did you get this?	6609
Security!	6608
"God	 no."	6607
Phew!	6605
It's all good.	6604
Let's...	6602
Thankyou.	6596
Will you marry me?	6595
We don't.	6594
I'm proud of you.	6593
Yea.	6591
My Lord.	6587
I'll go with you.	6584
Fast.	6583
You don't say.	6582
I'd love to.	6580
Sure thing.	6573
Doing what?	6565
How do you mean?	6562
I've got to go.	6557
Hold it right there.	6553
Hello there.	6551
Put me down!	6551
Got him.	6548

With you.	6544
Promise me.	6538
Where...	6534
Incoming!	6529
"Now	 come on."	6523
Speak up.	6521
You shut up!	6521
We got him.	6521
That's a lie.	6514
You're on.	6509
It's been a long time.	6506
That's why I'm here.	6505
What do you mean by that?	6504
Don't be scared.	6504
That's not possible.	6498
Nathan.	6495
You good?	6494
Don't look.	6494
"This way	 please."	6487
"No	 he's not."	6487
Paris.	6480
For God's sake!	6479
I'm afraid.	6478
That's the one.	6465
"Oh	 shut up."	6465
Get in here.	6463
I hope not.	6459
I'll call you later.	6458
Break it up!	6457
Wait up!	6455
What's wrong with him?	6455
"Yeah	 I think so."	6451
"Please	 no!"	6450
We know.	6446
What did you see?	6445
My bad.	6444
Aren't you?	6442
It's coming.	6430
"Yeah	 baby."	6421
Not so fast.	6421
Dick.	6419
Try again.	6415
I didn't know that.	6412
Sleep.	6407
All of us.	6405
Dinner?	6403
I'm late.	6401
Sophie!	6384
I can do that.	6383
Don't panic.	6381
This is insane.	6380
I give up.	6378
"Hey	 it's me."	6373
Time to go.	6373
HMM.	6362
Every day.	6356
You too?	6356
Gracias.	6355
I'M SORRY.	6354
Officer.	6354
Thanks very much.	6349
I want you.	6342
Not necessarily.	6340
He did it.	6339
If...	6339
Good Lord.	6339
Did he?	6333
Get your hands off me!	6329
Lee.	6325
No big deal.	6324
You killed him.	6320
A friend.	6319
"Whoa	 whoa	 whoa	 whoa."	6318
You should.	6314
On your knees!	6313
Everybody out!	6313
Can't.	6313
You remember?	6312
Safe.	6307
I want to.	6307
I swear to God.	6305
What did he do?	6303
That's her.	6296
Hannah.	6296
Open your eyes.	6290
Get back here!	6286
It's not working.	6284
Nina!	6282
Which way?	6282
I want to talk to you.	6281
You're gonna be okay.	6278
Oliver.	6270
People.	6270
What do you want me to say?	6265
"Come	 come."	6253
I lied.	6250
Does it matter?	6249
Terrible.	6244
Focus.	6242
Hide!	6241
Shame on you!	6240
It was you.	6240
"No	 I know."	6239
Music.	6237
He's not.	6236
"No	 I won't."	6235
That's the problem.	6228
"Yeah	 I guess."	6225
"No	 I'm good."	6224
Bruce.	6222
Men.	6220
I need help.	6216
There is.	6216
Ridiculous.	6211
We're going.	6209
Amanda.	6199
"Come on	 honey."	6198
What am I gonna do?	6198
"Yeah	 maybe."	6197
What's the big deal?	6196
Carol.	6196
"Yes	 he is."	6194
It works.	6186
Drop the gun!	6182
Is that okay?	6181
Piss off!	6179
It's not my fault.	6176
Children.	6176
"Okay	 look."	6174
Very much.	6169
You're beautiful.	6165
Terry.	6164
"Come on	 boys."	6164
He's good.	6157
I had no choice.	6156
Affirmative.	6150
Stay away from me.	6150
Your mother?	6147
Finished.	6147
Louis.	6146
Teacher!	6142
That's OK.	6141
That's not it.	6140
At last.	6138
What's next?	6137
What are you doing ?	6134
You have my word.	6129
Princess!	6126
Lord!	6119
"Oh	 that's right."	6115
What the fuck is that?	6113
Si.	6111
The police?	6105
No offense.	6104
You can't be serious.	6101
It's hot.	6095
Holy crap.	6095
Andrew.	6090
Time's up.	6088
It's the truth.	6086
Off you go.	6085
Stay away!	6084
Food.	6083
This is amazing.	6080
He's lying.	6076
Certainly not.	6072
"No	 you won't."	6070
I know him.	6064
Dance!	6055
I wasn't.	6055
Here they are.	6049
Nowhere.	6046
What is he doing?	6044
Heads up.	6044
He didn't.	6043
WHY?	6043
I'll think about it.	6042
Big deal.	6036
I guess not.	6036
Your name?	6032
Babe.	6027
"Hi	 there."	6027
Good point.	6026
What are you doin'?	6023
What's that mean?	6023
Please come in.	6023
With me.	6022
"Oh	 excuse me."	6022
A little bit.	6022
Shall we go?	6020
huh?	6020
"Aye	 aye	 sir."	6018
I'll see you.	6015
Ask him.	6014
Doug.	6013
I'm OK.	6012
Anne.	6012
Take a look at this.	6011
"Hey	 kid."	6011
What did you just say?	6008
How's he doing?	6005
Out of my way!	6004
Another one?	6004
Pass.	6002
Come with us.	6002
That was great.	6000
Do you love me?	5999
Find him.	5997
It's all over.	5997
"So	 what do you think?"	5995
May I come in?	5995
That's terrible.	5992
Fascinating.	5989
"Oh	 all right."	5989
Leave him.	5989
Try me.	5989
I do not.	5985
You there?	5985
What'd he say?	5984
Prove it.	5981
Like you.	5977
What does it say?	5973
What difference does it make?	5973
Once.	5968
"Stop	 stop."	5965
Yuck!	5961
Bless you.	5959
Kill them!	5959
Hang in there.	5958
We won!	5958
Let me see that.	5945
What's goin' on?	5943
I wonder.	5942
How nice.	5941
But you...	5940
"Okay	 yeah."	5934
Much better.	5933
Shut your mouth.	5933
Disgusting.	5933
I know what I'm doing.	5929
I suppose.	5927
You're safe.	5924
"Uh	 yes."	5920
"You know	"	5906
"Yeah	 that's it."	5905
Step back.	5896
You made it.	5889
I understand that.	5889
Jacob.	5889
In there.	5888
You won't.	5888
Not tonight.	5887
Hey there.	5884
It's weird.	5880
How is that possible?	5880
No reason.	5874
Set!	5870
What will you do?	5870
"Hey	 Mom."	5866
You wanted to see me?	5863
Farewell.	5859
I can tell.	5857
I'm working on it.	5857
Not for me.	5856
What's this about?	5856
It's dangerous.	5851
Good man.	5851
Traitor!	5850
Tell me the truth.	5849
You are right.	5849
Read it.	5848
"Oh	 yeah	 yeah."	5841
I'm begging you.	5836
Guard!	5836
Howard.	5835
It's her.	5832
What time?	5832
Give me the gun.	5829
Thief!	5829
AH!	5828
Whatever you say.	5827
Lie down.	5827
Ya!	5826
Greg.	5825
She's not here.	5825
"Thanks	 Dad."	5822
Honest.	5818
Don't ask.	5815
I trust you.	5814
That's not what I meant.	5814
"Oh	 jeez."	5812
Patrick.	5811
Are you listening?	5809
I'm fine!	5808
Edward.	5806
Screw you.	5800
Who's next?	5798
GO!	5797
It's been a while.	5791
Which is?	5791
Angela.	5789
"Hey	 there."	5789
You don't believe me?	5784
You're joking.	5784
Don't you remember?	5782
You first.	5781
How can you say that?	5781
What is happening?	5776
REALLY?	5769
Women.	5767
Keep the change.	5766
Murderer!	5764
On the contrary.	5761
Save me!	5759
He knows.	5757
Can I ask you a question?	5753
What's wrong with that?	5744
"Yes	 we do."	5733
I'm going in.	5733
It'll be fine.	5731
Al.	5719
Fun.	5717
"And	 uh..."	5717
You promised.	5714
Whatever!	5714
Let me see it.	5712
You gotta be kidding me.	5711
"Move	 move!"	5708
Happy birthday to you	5707
Don't touch it.	5706
Where is he now?	5704
Merci.	5703
Says who?	5703
Frankie!	5699
I can't wait.	5695
Maybe you're right.	5694
That's disgusting.	5685
To what?	5685
She's beautiful.	5681
Somebody help me!	5676
Evening.	5674
Walk.	5674
Tyler!	5673
I don't know you.	5672
"Yes	 I can."	5670
Are you married?	5669
come on.	5668
Simple.	5664
I don't want to die.	5660
They do.	5659
So be it.	5656
It's easy.	5653
You know what I think?	5651
Friend.	5650
Tell me something.	5643
Where do you live?	5641
It's all my fault.	5637
My daughter.	5635
"Come on	 then."	5635
At ease.	5634
Isn't that right?	5632
Up there.	5630
Allow me.	5629
What you got?	5627
We should go.	5626
Attaboy.	5623
Where did you get that?	5620
Sally!	5619
Angel.	5618
Cease fire!	5617
There's no time.	5614
It's not like that.	5613
Stan!	5613
Family.	5610
Get inside.	5609
"Yes	 dear."	5608
GOOD.	5608
Just shut up.	5607
That's not good.	5607
Where'd he go?	5606
That's mine.	5596
"Hello	 darling."	5588
We're on our way.	5587
Appreciate it.	5586
What's with you?	5584
How did you do that?	5579
"Look	 I'm sorry."	5578
He's okay.	5577
Don.	5576
Nobody move!	5575
"Look	 look."	5575
Jackie.	5568
Where are you taking me?	5567
Jonathan!	5567
"Shh	 shh."	5564
Have a drink.	5562
Do you know who I am?	5562
Louder!	5560
"Hey	 babe."	5559
Two minutes.	5558
Mac.	5555
That was good.	5554
Positive.	5552
A woman.	5548
"Move	 move	 move!"	5547
"Yes	 it does."	5547
Admit it.	5546
How did you know that?	5544
So did I.	5541
"Come on	 buddy."	5541
Oui.	5540
What are we doing here?	5540
Charlotte.	5538
"All right	 man."	5537
And what?	5536
Where is everybody?	5533
"Here	 here."	5532
Jessica.	5529
He's all right.	5528
I didn't say anything.	5526
Oooh!	5522
Donna.	5516
Make way!	5515
Of course you are.	5514
Warning.	5514
Where did you go?	5508
"Come on	 get up."	5505
What's he doing here?	5502
Eva!	5499
THANKS.	5499

It's about time.	5488
I'm afraid not.	5487
Marie.	5486
"Shh	 shh	 shh."	5485
"Oh	 uh..."	5484
"Hey	 what's going on?"	5482
Unless...	5482
Waiter!	5480
My god.	5480
Such as?	5475
Get them!	5469
Retreat!	5465
"Yes	 I have."	5463
I made a mistake.	5460
I haven't.	5458
Hell.	5458
"Oh	 Lord."	5454
I got an idea.	5453
You have the right to remain silent.	5451
Yet.	5451
It was great.	5448
There's more.	5445
Call the police.	5443
My love.	5442
Do you hear that?	5441
You're leaving?	5439
Why would I do that?	5438
You're the best.	5438
"Sure	 sure."	5435
Repeat.	5434
Told you.	5433
I saw him.	5430
To me.	5430
What can we do?	5429
You're not going anywhere.	5427
Settle down.	5425
Get dressed.	5421
Long time no see.	5419
"So	 what?"	5418
"Thank you	 ma'am."	5414
What the fuck is this?	5411
I'm with you.	5410
"No	 no	 no	 no	 no	 no."	5407
Try.	5405
Don't even think about it.	5393
Just tell me.	5392
I killed him.	5390
Good question.	5387
On it.	5381
What just happened?	5379
Nobody!	5376
I don't know what happened.	5374
All set.	5373
"Yes	 we are."	5371
Gun!	5364
We're not.	5358
Open your mouth.	5357
That's my boy.	5355
How did you...	5354
Hungry?	5354

I really am.	5335
You don't know me.	5332
Champagne?	5331
That's you.	5329
I can't tell you.	5329
Anybody home?	5327

Sleep well.	5229
I've had enough.	5228
Black.	5222
Freedom!	5222
Don't you worry.	5219
"Very good	 sir."	5217

Way to go.	5213
Don't forget.	5209
Jennifer.	5207
Is she okay?	5206
Your Honor.	5205
You coming?	5204
Alive.	5204

Shut up	5193
That's a good one.	5192
UH...	5191
So are you.	5191
"Yeah	 come on."	5190

How did you find me?	5151
You'll be all right.	5148
Are you scared?	5145
What happened here?	5143
That's perfect.	5142
"Oh	 gosh."	5142
Go to bed.	5140
I'm off.	5139
Do you know why?	5139
Dylan!	5138
"No	 come on."	5131
Don't be shy.	5130
My turn.	5128
Duh.	5125
You don't have to do this.	5123
I'm a doctor.	5123
Toby.	5122
Shoot me.	5122
You heard him.	5115
Dear.	5115
She was.	5115
Don't you dare!	5113
APPLAUSE	5108
It's no use.	5106
From what?	5105
nder M@nkÃÃ â¢	5104
You want some?	5101
You sure about that?	5092
What brings you here?	5091
In.	5091

Tell us.	5083
You're lucky.	5081
I suppose so.	5078
Behind you!	5076
"Yeah	 I got it."	5076

I KNOW.	5073
What's yours?	5069
It's just that...	5068
Do you understand that?	5067
"Wait	 wait	 wait	 wait."	5067
"Fine	 fine."	5066
Come on out.	5065
Didn't you?	5063
But don't worry.	5062
He's crazy.	5061
"All right	 all right	 all right."	5057
I insist.	5057
Hold him.	5057
You saved my life.	5057
You're a liar.	5055
He's back.	5054
So do you.	5054
"Well	 good."	5053
I'll be all right.	5052
Twenty.	5052
I'm sorry to hear that.	5049
The end.	5049
Let me get this straight.	5049
I can't sleep.	5047
"Three	 two	 one."	5044
You should go.	5040
Say...	5038
You know her?	5036
It's like...	5036
"All right	 here we go."	5036
Proceed.	5032
Who did this?	5032
Whatever you want.	5028
Beer?	5027
Move on.	5027
Elena.	5023
"Hey	 you know what?"	5023
I know what you mean.	5020
Put it on.	5020
I don't want to talk about it.	5019
That's fantastic.	5018
You know what that means?	5017
Oh really?	5017
It's none of your business.	5017
S...	5016
Fucker!	5015
You're drunk.	5009
Pop!	5007
Olivia.	5006
You're hurting me.	5004
Give me a hand.	5004
It's ridiculous.	5003
"Yeah	 I am."	4995
I win.	4992
It's wonderful.	4989
Hardly.	4987
Come closer.	4987
Kid!	4987
Betty.	4984
Is he all right?	4984
What a coincidence.	4983
"Good evening	 sir."	4980
Want some?	4976

Off!	4974
Get her!	4973
Look around.	4972

Norman.	4968
"Oh	 I get it."	4968
Bonjour.	4964
What kind?	4963
Got that?	4962
I'm warning you.	4961
That's the point.	4956
Robin!	4956
We don't have much time.	4956
My husband.	4955
"Yeah	 I..."	4948
Quite.	4946
"Hold on	 hold on."	4944
I don't know what you mean.	4943
Why are you crying?	4939
Casey.	4938
I'm so happy.	4935
What would you do?	4933
That's my girl.	4931
Smart.	4930
WOW.	4928
"Ha	 ha	 ha."	4927
It isn't.	4927
Give me.	4924
Zoe.	4920
Ian.	4918
It's simple.	4917
Just stop.	4914
Boring.	4914
Kill her!	4913
"OH	 MY GOD."	4908
"Now	 listen."	4905
Likewise.	4902
Mmm-mmm.	4901
"No	 he didn't."	4901
"No	 we're not."	4900
Close.	4900
It's not possible.	4898
It's incredible.	4898
It's disgusting.	4897
For sure.	4893
Here we go again.	4891
You do it.	4885
Mia.	4884
No comment.	4883
On three.	4882
We got to go.	4882
Sustained.	4877
Hang on a second.	4876
Scared?	4873
"Oh	 damn."	4870
Why you?	4870
Don't say anything.	4869
Like me.	4868
I can't help you.	4868
"Yeah	 me	 too."	4866
Too much.	4866
I know you do.	4864
You know who I am?	4859
On what?	4858
Zero.	4857
That is correct.	4855
It's locked.	4853
"Oh	 it's you."	4853
She's alive.	4847
Poor thing.	4846
Is that him?	4846
Cold.	4845
Move over.	4844
You alright?	4844
I'll be damned.	4844
That is...	4841
I'm gonna go.	4841
How about it?	4840
It's not what you think.	4840
I saw you.	4840
Give it.	4840
Rebecca.	4839
Your Grace.	4837
PLEASE.	4836
Are you listening to me?	4836
I don't know about that.	4836
Why did you do it?	4832
Pity.	4832
Higher.	4831
You're gonna be fine.	4830
"Please	 don't."	4829
Bollocks.	4829
Hush.	4828
"No	 why?"	4827
Don't worry about that.	4827
Get the hell out of here.	4826
A girl.	4825
Catch!	4824
Heil Hitler.	4823
Call an ambulance!	4818
Madame.	4816
I know what you're thinking.	4815
You're doing great.	4815
"Thanks	 guys."	4813

That's very good.	4392
By who?	4391
Is he here?	4391
That's all I know.	4389
"Knock	 knock."	4388
"Thank you	 Doctor."	4387
What can I get you?	4387
It's a trap.	4386
Pa!	4385
Shut the door.	4384
Let's dance.	4383
What am I doing here?	4381
Everywhere.	4380
Shut it!	4378

I'm gonna...	4341
"No	 stop!"	4339
Don't listen to him.	4333
Hey you!	4333
We gotta get out of here.	4331
It was nothing.	4326
"I don't know	 sir."	4324
Why would he do that?	4319
I've got you.	4319
Open the gate!	4317
It's getting late.	4317
My dad.	4317
My man.	4316

Where's the money?	4291
Jerk.	4290
Come down.	4289
That's beautiful.	4288
Thank goodness.	4284

See what I mean?	4279
What are you afraid of?	4278
Just now.	4275
Idiots!	4275
What are you doing there?	4275
It doesn't make sense.	4273
It's unbelievable.	4273
"No	 you're right."	4272
Stay right there.	4272
"Hey	 stop!"	4271
Where was I?	4270
You get it?	4269
I've been thinking.	4269
You're funny.	4269
"Come on	 hurry up."	4268
"Please	 sit down."	4266
That was awesome.	4266
What's on your mind?	4265
My sister.	4265
By the way...	4265

Magic.	4233
"One moment	 please."	4232
See for yourself.	4232
Listen carefully.	4230
Put that down.	4229
Is that correct?	4228
We have a problem.	4225
What is going on here?	4224
Kiss!	4223
Come to me.	4223
Not right now.	4220
Drop your weapon!	4219
"Oh	 um..."	4218
Get him out!	4217

I don't like this.	4216
Have a good time.	4215
Move aside.	4215
Back to work.	4214
"Oh	 oh	 oh."	4214

It's terrible.	4212
Who told you?	4209
What are you talkin' about?	4209
Kitty!	4204
You're absolutely right.	4200
Not true.	4198

That's the spirit.	4173
Randy.	4172
You go ahead.	4167
It wasn't.	4167
Aargh!	4165
"Go	 go	 go	 go	 go!"	4165
He will.	4163
What a mess.	4160
Answer!	4160
O.K.	4159

Great idea.	4154
This is serious.	4153
Get out of my house!	4152
Let's roll.	4152

Can I talk to you?	4127
What makes you say that?	4127
Leave us alone.	4127
You're out.	4126
Play.	4125
Tell me what?	4124
"Yeah	 you do."	4122
Bro!	4121

What are you thinking about?	4121
"Hey	 boss."	4120
"Excuse me	 ma'am."	4119
Sid.	4119
You know how it is.	4119
Someone!	4118
"Now	 look."	4117
I'm exhausted.	4113

On my way.	4111
"Yeah	 you."	4109
Jackson.	4108
Go get him.	4108
Chicken.	4107
"No	 I'm serious."	4106
SÃ­.	4102

I never said that.	4101
Tara.	4101

That'd be great.	4097
Ruth.	4096
You serious?	4096
Get some sleep.	4096
I'll handle it.	4096
But now...	4095
And why?	4095

Wish me luck.	4090
I won't be long.	4089
Go inside.	4088
Up here.	4088
You asshole!	4087
Don't leave.	4087
What about this?	4086
"Yes	 she is."	4084
Give me the keys.	4084
Maybe later.	4082
This is my house.	4081
Present.	4080
Keep it up.	4074
My fault.	4074
You're done.	4073

Wait a moment.	4060
Let's hear it.	4060
"Aw	 come on."	4060
No good.	4058
Nothing more.	4057
What are you staring at?	4054
You know what I'm talking about.	4054
I changed my mind.	4053
Oscar!	4051
"Oh	 that's good."	4050
Go fuck yourself.	4049
What's that smell?	4047
It's a...	4046
On the ground!	4045
"Hey	 sweetie."	4044
I'll be in touch.	4043
Is she all right?	4040
She does.	4040
Do you remember me?	4038
Let's get started.	4038

Give it here.	3991
God damn!	3990
A man.	3989
"Heh	 heh."	3989
What the fuck are you talking about?	3988
"Oh	 cool."	3987
Why are you doing this to me?	3987
Catch him!	3986
What are you laughing at?	3985
Not like that.	3982
Nothing yet.	3982
I'm terribly sorry.	3981
"Yeah	 why?"	3978
Did you hear?	3978
Just me.	3976
What are you doing in here?	3975
"Yeah	 no."	3975
You again?	3974
Pick up.	3973

About?	3960
My mistake.	3960
"Now	 wait a minute."	3959
What did they say?	3954
I don't see anything.	3952
Good luck with that.	3951
You're coming with me.	3950
"Oh	 don't worry."	3950

Really good.	3931
Keep looking.	3930
You did this.	3930
Let's get going.	3928
What's this all about?	3925
I almost forgot.	3925
What do you want to know?	3925
You didn't know?	3923
We need you.	3918
And that?	3917
There he goes.	3916
Step aside.	3914
Sandy.	3914
"Hi	 Daddy."	3912
Be patient.	3908
I don't have it.	3907
I have something for you.	3907
"Hey	 how you doing?"	3907
Never again.	3907
It doesn't make any sense.	3906
Alicia.	3905
Don't look at me like that.	3905
I really don't know.	3904
So what do we do?	3903
You did good.	3901
Nice job.	3900

My lady.	3891
Give me a minute.	3891
How would you know?	3891
By whom?	3888
Did something happen?	3885
"Oh	 there you are."	3885
I'll say.	3883
It's just	3883
Oh dear.	3879
It's all yours.	3879
It's a joke.	3878
Ken!	3878
I'll drive.	3876
"Well	 why not?"	3874
You listen to me.	3874
Answer the question.	3874

I've been looking for you.	3209
Come quickly.	3209
Apparently not.	3208
"Thank you	 gentlemen."	3208
Nothing much.	3207
Don't give up.	3207
What are you trying to do?	3206
Let's get to work.	3206
"Um	 no."	3206
Watch yourself.	3206
It's happening.	3205
Clearly.	3205
"Hey	 how are you?"	3204
She's coming.	3203
It's dead.	3201
Let's take a look.	3201
H...	3201
You're wasting your time.	3201
"Please	 come in."	3200
Are we?	3198
What was her name?	3198
That's my job.	3198
I already did.	3197
Guy!	3197
It's really good.	3196
I'm curious.	3196
My mom.	3196
"Yeah	 no problem."	3196
That doesn't matter.	3195
Stay close.	3194
Same.	3194
I was thinking...	3193
First...	3190
I should have known.	3190
How does it feel?	3189
I'm stuck.	3189
Debbie.	3189
Anything at all.	3187
I hate him.	3187
Goal!	3186
You're home.	3185
Don't be late.	3183
You're out of your mind.	3182
Very interesting.	3178
That'll do.	3177
I'm worried.	3176
"Right away	 sir."	3175
"Yeah	 great."	3175
"Yes	 I'm fine."	3174
Do you know what I mean?	3174
When was that?	3174
King!	3174
It's not good.	3173
It's all there.	3173
How did it happen?	3171
Ssh!	3170
Let me finish.	3169
"I'm sorry	 I'm sorry."	3168
Not that I know of.	3168
"Hey	 Mike."	3167
"Yeah	 sorry."	3166
It didn't work.	3166
President.	3166

It's a pleasure.	3111
Everything's gonna be fine.	3111
Thanks for your help.	3111
It's not you.	3110
"Yeah	 I'm good."	3110
"All right	 boys."	3109
Nervous?	3109

Apologize.	3089
I'll get him.	3087
"Bye	 guys."	3085
You don't know what you're talking about.	3085
Who was he?	3085
You don't have to do that.	3084
What are you guys doing here?	3084
The baby.	3084
Barely.	3083
Nicholas.	3083

What does he do?	3075
That sounds good.	3074
Walk away.	3074

Somewhere.	3049
This is all your fault.	3049
You lie.	3048

It's embarrassing.	3047
And for what?	3047
Ready to go?	3046
You're pregnant.	3046
Empty.	3045
"All right	 okay."	3043

"I got it	 I got it."	3032
I'm going out.	3030
What the hell does that mean?	3030
Can I talk to you for a second?	3029
It's not bad.	3029
"Yes	 my lord."	3028

I don't know what that means.	2963
Ruby.	2961
He said that?	2958
It wasn't your fault.	2956
Be nice.	2955

Just forget it.	2954
I see him.	2953

"Okay	 so..."	2925
That's none of your business.	2925
Absolutely nothing.	2923
I loved it.	2922
Bring him in.	2922

With whom?	2797
I should.	2796
I feel...	2796
Do you love him?	2795
Is that good?	2795
Never heard of it.	2794
He doesn't.	2794
"No	 I got it."	2794
Find it.	2793
Live!	2793
NOTHING.	2792
I might.	2792

Are you threatening me?	2780
Where the hell is he?	2778
How about now?	2777
I don't have one.	2776
What's that about?	2776

How long has it been?	2752
School.	2752
Out of the question.	2752
Watch him.	2752
"Yes	 it's me."	2751
Move away.	2750
What's she doing?	2750
Take it or leave it.	2750
I'll be okay.	2748
Quite right.	2748

You look nice.	2747
Help me out.	2747

Lola.	2724
I don't have time.	2723
Holy fuck.	2723
Your sister?	2723
Don't talk like that.	2722
What of it?	2722
How are you today?	2722
This is your fault.	2721
It's broken.	2721
Please hurry.	2720
Ask her.	2719

"Fine	 thank you."	2719
I know her.	2718
Antonio!	2718
"Yes	 we did."	2716
Extra!	2715
Try it again.	2715
We didn't.	2714
I see that.	2714
What's he like?	2714
Let's see it.	2714
Boyfriend?	2713
They're good.	2713
"Ho	 ho	 ho!"	2713
To the right.	2712
There's something else.	2712
You shouldn't have.	2712
"Well	 guess what?"	2712
Your what?	2712
Say no more.	2712
They're...	2711
"Well	 I don't."	2711
It's very simple.	2710
I've missed you.	2710
Eventually.	2710
It's not worth it.	2710
"Yeah	 it was."	2710
There's nothing I can do.	2709
What a waste.	2709
How'd you do that?	2708
Pierre!	2708
Which means...	2708
Poor guy.	2706
Why are you looking at me like that?	2706
My car!	2706
Be right there.	2705
He's not dead.	2704
Clean.	2704

"Well	 that's great."	2694
Another?	2694
Sad.	2694
"Wait	 no."	2693
Throw it!	2692
Three months.	2692
This is my fault.	2692
"Good day	 sir."	2692
What more do you want?	2692
Where were you last night?	2691
I'll go first.	2691
Any ideas?	2690
"All right	 listen up."	2690
But this...	2690
What'd she say?	2688
"No	 they don't."	2688
Make yourself comfortable.	2688
My child.	2688
You're making a mistake.	2687
As usual.	2687
I wouldn't do that.	2687
Kay.	2686
I'm so scared.	2686
Philip.	2686
Kill them all!	2685
Who did this to you?	2685
Stop fighting!	2684
No thank you.	2684
"Yeah	 what?"	2684
"Come on	 everybody."	2684
"Quiet	 please."	2684
What's the rush?	2684
"No	 I'm okay."	2683
You saw it.	2683
Where do you want to go?	2682
What do you...	2681
What guy?	2680
"Oh	 absolutely."	2680
I'll see you around.	2679
Did she?	2678
Where're you going?	2678
For us.	2678
I feel good.	2677
Anything wrong?	2677
Can I get you something?	2677
Call me back.	2676

Very clever.	2675
Let's get the hell out of here.	2675
Cooper.	2675
Grow up.	2674

How much do you want?	2668
It just happened.	2667
Sure you can.	2666
Not there.	2665

We have to talk.	2654
"Sorry	 guys."	2654
What's in it?	2653
"Well	 now."	2653
You're free to go.	2652
Is there?	2652
I'll be right down.	2652
You can say that again.	2651
Are you blind?	2651
You're pathetic.	2650
I hate this.	2650
Damn straight.	2649
I can imagine.	2649

At your service.	2449
"No	 I do."	2449
An hour?	2448
Woof!	2448
What makes you think that?	2448
Is she here?	2448
You see it?	2447
That's not bad.	2447
I told you that.	2447
What's going on with you?	2447
Just take it.	2447
Belle.	2446
I don't drink.	2446
Ice.	2446
"Well	 that's it."	2445

What do you wanna do?	2433
I wish I knew.	2433
I want to go.	2432
That's terrific.	2432
"Five	 six	 seven	 eight."	2432
No more questions.	2432
It was awful.	2432
"Yeah	 I will."	2431
It's this way.	2431

Are you happy now?	2430
Yum.	2430

"Here	 boy."	2429
But then...	2429
Paula?	2429
Don't thank me.	2427
HA HA HA!	2427
I'm an idiot.	2427
Oh fuck.	2427
I killed her.	2426
Who do you work for?	2426
Not good enough.	2426
Come and get me.	2425
You're a good man.	2425
Nikki.	2424
Take your pick.	2423
Piece of shit.	2422
Not likely.	2422
Look who it is.	2422
Sylvia.	2422
I hope you're right.	2421
Do you read?	2421
In the car.	2420
How old?	2420
Think it over.	2419
Are you cold?	2419
Omar.	2417
I'm not ready.	2417
We got this.	2416
I hate that.	2416
Useless.	2415
Speak of the devil.	2415
"Certainly	 sir."	2415
Is anyone there?	2414
How could you do that?	2414
Eggs.	2414
That's life.	2413
Donnie!	2413
Not so good.	2413
Take it out.	2412
Be seated.	2412

Have you eaten?	2408
Your Excellency.	2408
Gah!	2408
Thank you for that.	2407
Speak for yourself.	2407
I haven't done anything.	2407
I loved her.	2407
Good shot.	2406
My name is...	2405
Hey guys.	2405
Like I said.	2405
Get up here.	2405
"Look	 man."	2405
My treat.	2404
"Hey	 how's it going?"	2404
Maybe so.	2403

We're too late.	2402
You mean it?	2401
Gene.	2401
"Right	 yeah."	2401
It's ready.	2400
Ram!	2400
Good thinking.	2400
Hands on your head.	2399
Just get out.	2399
Don't answer that.	2398
Did you sleep well?	2398
You know this.	2398
Are you still there?	2397
Don't mind me.	2397
I'll tell you why.	2397
"Come on	 sweetheart."	2397
It's us.	2397

The car.	2392
You got a minute?	2391
"Come on	 sit down."	2391
His wife.	2391
You lose.	2390
None at all.	2389
You remember me?	2389
I'm lost.	2388
Good call.	2388
This is impossible.	2387
"Excuse me	 gentlemen."	2386
It's not gonna happen.	2386
"Okay	 ready?"	2385
And yours?	2385
Curtis.	2385
I love them.	2384
Yes and no.	2383
Shots fired.	2383
Motherfuckers!	2383
Don't hurt him.	2383
Do that.	2383
Hurrah!	2383
Spock.	2382
I won't go.	2382
Ladies first.	2381
Hang up.	2380
I need a favor.	2380
It's not over.	2379
"Okay	 stop."	2379
It's my turn.	2379
"Okay	 hold on."	2378
Are you awake?	2378
You can't go.	2378
I can try.	2377
Timmy!	2377
Mr President.	2377
EVE.	2377
You came back.	2376
Another time.	2376
Find them.	2376

Won't you sit down?	2375
You don't trust me?	2375
Bernard.	2375
They know.	2375
"Yeah	 it does."	2374
Fourteen.	2374
No sweat.	2374
I think you do.	2372
Bah!	2372
Hang on a minute.	2372
'Bye.	2371
Urgh!	2370
Are you stupid?	2370
Christmas.	2370
"Well	 congratulations."	2370
Simone!	2370
"No	 she didn't."	2369
You're killing me.	2369
Beware!	2369
What has happened?	2369
Please don't kill me.	2369
"Bye	 honey."	2369
How do you like it?	2368

It won't take long.	2365
I wonder why.	2365
Rosa.	2365
There's nothing to worry about.	2363
"No	 not me."	2363
Denise.	2362
What you want?	2362
I'll stay.	2362
Brandon.	2361
It's safe.	2360
"Well	 I am."	2359
"But	 sir..."	2359
"I'm sorry	 I..."	2358
"I love you	 baby."	2357
It's not that easy.	2357
There's nothing we can do.	2356
It's freezing.	2356
Is she dead?	2356
Fuck them.	2356
It's that simple.	2355
But I'm not.	2354
Tell me more.	2352
We are here.	2351
"Oh	 this?"	2351
Do you remember that?	2351
Moses!	2350
What did you do to him?	2350
Exterminate!	2350
Take her away.	2350
That is it.	2350
"Here	 look."	2349
Only you.	2349
This is beautiful.	2348
I tell you.	2348
Keep still.	2348
I feel great.	2348

We're going in.	2341
Jackpot.	2341
How's it goin'?	2341
It is you.	2341
I feel fine.	2340
That's what she said.	2340
"Not really	 no."	2340
I've got him.	2339
Mario!	2338
"Hello	 ladies."	2338
I'll wait for you.	2338
Once more.	2337
This time.	2336
You told me.	2336
You liar!	2336
"Hey	 watch it!"	2336

At home.	2335
Good choice.	2335

"Why	 yes."	2333
Case closed.	2332
We go.	2332
We're gonna die!	2332
Ella!	2332
Why didn't you say so?	2332
Is that better?	2331
Good stuff.	2330
Enough is enough.	2330
"Thank you	 darling."	2330
I wanna talk to you.	2329
Fall in!	2329
We know that.	2329
You stay.	2328
What's happening here?	2327
That's what happened.	2326
He what?	2326
Let me handle this.	2326
That can't be.	2325
Who are you talking about?	2325
So tell me.	2325
Be quick.	2325
Can you believe this?	2324
Marvin.	2324
For Christ's sake!	2324
Perfectly.	2324
Feel it.	2324
A year?	2324
Burn!	2324
For who?	2323
Haven't you heard?	2322
I know what you're doing.	2322
Can we go now?	2322
Amelia.	2322
"Why	 thank you."	2321
It's alive!	2321
Thanks for asking.	2320
I gotta...	2320
"Oh	 stop."	2320
Your dad?	2320

Apology accepted.	2319
Hands behind your back.	2319
I'm here to help you.	2319
"Come on	 kids."	2318
I'm counting on you.	2318
"Come on	 you."	2317
"No	 that's fine."	2317
Otherwise...	2317
Granted.	2317
How we doing?	2316
Keep your head down.	2316
Deal with it.	2316
You can do that?	2315
No answer.	2315
Too long.	2315
I'm alone.	2314
Thanks anyway.	2314
Do you love her?	2313
It's Christmas.	2313
I don't have any.	2312
"No	 you know what?"	2312
The truth is...	2312
And what is that?	2312
Get me out!	2311
Perfect timing.	2311
I'm in love.	2311
Wait there.	2309
What do I know?	2309
Isn't it obvious?	2309
Please have a seat.	2309
How does it work?	2309
What's this for?	2309
Murphy.	2308
Good enough.	2308
So what!	2308
She told me.	2307
You said that.	2307
Elsa?	2306

That's alright.	2306
I am Groot.	2306

I'm gonna kill him.	2300
Eighteen.	2300
Give up?	2300
"Go on	 go on."	2300
Get away from her!	2300
Bad idea.	2300
She's my daughter.	2299
"You	 uh..."	2299
Not possible.	2299
I know you did.	2298
"Yes	 why?"	2298
I'll come back.	2298
Keep trying.	2298
What did you call me?	2297
Everything OK?	2296
I never...	2296
It's pretty.	2296
You're a cop.	2296
Warren.	2296
Don't hang up.	2295
I was worried about you.	2295
Darn it.	2295
It's my birthday.	2295
This is outrageous.	2295
"Hey	 boys."	2295
That's very nice.	2294
I'll drink to that.	2294
Don't look back.	2293
What the fuck are you doing here?	2293
It's not easy.	2293
I'm not here.	2292
"Hey	 where you going?"	2291
What about that?	2291
Did you say something?	2291
What is that thing?	2291
Over my dead body.	2290
Is that bad?	2290
"Nothing	 sir."	2289
Please don't hurt me.	2289
Just great.	2288
Why'd you do that?	2288
Turn right.	2287
From whom?	2287
Right on time.	2287
He's there.	2287
Don't be sorry.	2286
"Oh	 yeah	 right."	2286
Is there something wrong?	2286
Question.	2284
Didn't you hear me?	2284
"I'm sorry	 okay?"	2282
I'll see you in the morning.	2282
"Hey	 John."	2282
I believe in you.	2281
You've got it.	2281
Vera!	2281
I don't want to hurt you.	2280
Everybody knows that.	2279
"Yes	 I remember."	2279
"Hey	 Doc."	2278
Read.	2278
Not so much.	2277
Melanie.	2277
Sleeping.	2277
You're not listening.	2277
Jesus fucking Christ.	2276
"Yeah	 that's me."	2276
You're very welcome.	2275
It's your choice.	2274
Then do it.	2274
I know you're in there.	2274
I don't have a choice.	2273
It's too risky.	2273
It's not the same.	2272
"Here	 take it."	2272
Do what you want.	2272
A gift.	2271
"Yeah	 I don't know."	2271
Trust.	2271
Almost done.	2271
"All right	 you know what?"	2270
You have to help me.	2270
I'll find you.	2270
Camera.	2269
We all did.	2269
Is it serious?	2269
Just think about it.	2269
"Thank you	 guys."	2269
"So	 what do you say?"	2268
He's in there.	2268
"Yeah	 I understand."	2268
Is he alive?	2268
I care.	2268
Diego!	2266
You better.	2266
Then why are you here?	2266
Stuart.	2266
That would be nice.	2266
"OK	 let's go."	2266
Busted.	2265
We don't have a choice.	2265
Gimme that.	2265
Aunt!	2264
Dance with me.	2263
My life.	2263
What are you doin' here?	2263
Do you need anything?	2263

Have a good one.	2260
"OH	 GOD."	2259
Please tell me.	2259
What a day.	2259
That's not all.	2258
I love this.	2258
I'll take care of you.	2258
Remember this?	2258
A'ight.	2257
"Not bad	 huh?"	2257
I remember that.	2257
Scotch.	2256
Hold tight.	2256
Come home.	2256
One sec.	2255
There's nothing you can do.	2254
This is your last chance.	2254
Prick.	2253
Juliet!	2253
Hallo?	2252
"Let's go	 let's go	 let's go!"	2252
Do you see that?	2251
Sheila.	2251
Jenna.	2250
That's what.	2250
You're going?	2250
Sure I do.	2249
What the hell is he doing?	2249
"Yes	 master."	2249
Hold that thought.	2248
This is absurd.	2247
You mind?	2246
Just drive.	2246
How wonderful.	2246
Do you see it?	2246
Do you believe that?	2245
"Hey	 dad."	2244
"No	 I mean it."	2244
"No	 not you."	2243
North.	2243
I've been looking all over for you.	2242

Give me your phone.	2241
You live here?	2241
Hear me out.	2241
Esther.	2240
"OK	 then."	2240
"Hi	 it's me."	2240
We'll figure it out.	2240
Can you see me?	2240
Soldiers!	2240
I'm gone.	2239
"All right	 sir."	2238
You know the drill.	2238
Little bit.	2238
Wednesday.	2236

Apologies.	2235
I'm not joking.	2234
England.	2234
"Yes	 absolutely."	2233
"Yes	 we can."	2232
"Yes	 okay."	2232
You sure about this?	2232
He's getting away!	2232
I'm leaving now.	2232
How about...	2232
Stop what?	2232
I couldn't believe it.	2232
I'm alright.	2231
Course.	2231
So now what?	2231
He likes you.	2231
How are you holding up?	2230
Odd.	2230
Just leave.	2229
What--?	2229
You and I.	2229
Then go.	2229
I was kidding.	2229
Christina.	2228
"Hey	 are you okay?"	2227
Fair?	2227
It happened.	2227
Standing by.	2226
I don't like you.	2226
Virginia.	2226
Going somewhere?	2226
Be a man.	2226
Murderers!	2226
Have a good trip.	2225
"Sir	 please."	2225
I feel sick.	2225
Not once.	2224
I'll get you!	2224
Davis.	2224
Anton.	2223
Where did that come from?	2223
Art.	2222
French.	2222
"This way	 sir."	2221
What did you do to her?	2221
Who knew?	2221
Very nice to meet you.	2221
Is this yours?	2220
"Wait	 wait	 wait	 wait	 wait."	2220
FUCK!	2220
"Yes	 she did."	2220
How far?	2219
Classic.	2218
OF COURSE.	2218
How do you know this?	2218
We got company.	2217
Didn't you know?	2217
Let's have a drink.	2217
I'd like to.	2216
Unh-unh.	2216
You can't go in there.	2216
Have I?	2216
It's your call.	2216
I wasn't there.	2216
Merry!	2215
He's a friend.	2214
We're out of here.	2214
"Okay	 I will."	2213
"No	 that's all right."	2213
That should do it.	2213
Hold on one second.	2213
Nothing serious.	2213
Snake!	2212
Where else?	2212
What could I do?	2212
That's pretty good.	2211
Also...	2211
Let's hope so.	2211
You can't stay here.	2210
That's them.	2210
Alec?	2210
"Oh	 I forgot."	2208
Name it.	2208
Have it your way.	2208
Darn.	2208
It's going to be okay.	2207
Where are they going?	2207
That's a good boy.	2207
"Come on	 darling."	2207
Watch your back.	2206
Nothing's wrong.	2206
Who gives a shit?	2206
You're my best friend.	2206

Get out of my sight.	1809
"So	 what do we do?"	1809
Still here.	1809
Out there.	1808
It's as simple as that.	1807
I think it is.	1807
Eugene.	1807
Open fire!	1807
"You don't get it	 do you?"	1806
Are you sure you're okay?	1806
Evidence.	1806
I'll cover you.	1806
"Well	 what happened?"	1806
Rolling.	1805
Alas!	1804
Don't blame me.	1804
What do you think it is?	1804
Where did it go?	1804
We have to leave.	1804
I want my money.	1803
In the kitchen.	1803

We're just friends.	1798
A child.	1798
That's my car!	1798
For a while.	1798
Did it?	1797
All gone.	1797
You're my friend.	1797
We're a team.	1797
Rain.	1797
"What	 then?"	1797
I can't stay.	1796
It's enough.	1796

What are you doing tonight?	1795
That is good.	1795
Twenty-five.	1794
Why don't you tell me?	1794
They killed him.	1794
I'll catch up.	1794
This doesn't make any sense.	1794
Keep away!	1793
"I just	 uh..."	1793
I said I was sorry.	1793
I didn't see you.	1793
Just leave it.	1793
Roman!	1792
You didn't have to do that.	1792
Well played.	1792
The gun.	1792
I couldn't agree more.	1792
"Yes	 that's true."	1792

Get in the truck.	1791

Not that way.	1785
I'll tell her.	1785
"Thanks	 mate."	1785
I respect that.	1784
I know this.	1783
I'll take him.	1783
Don't talk to me.	1783
Release him.	1783
You two know each other?	1783

Now it's my turn.	1771
They're great.	1770
Not all of them.	1770
Are you a doctor?	1770
That's that.	1770
Take them away.	1770
Why did you do this?	1769
I'm not going to hurt you.	1769
Kinda.	1769
Are you certain?	1769
You wanna go?	1769
That's all there is to it.	1769
How beautiful!	1769
Disappear.	1769
This isn't over.	1769
Home sweet home.	1768

He's in.	1767
Do you want one?	1766
Shopping.	1766
Are you going?	1766
We've got a problem.	1765

I'll wait here.	1756
It was my idea.	1756
Quietly.	1755
Just look.	1755
Aren't you ashamed?	1754
"Oh	 thank you very much."	1754
Don't be angry.	1754
For all of us.	1754
That girl.	1754
Where does he live?	1753
Do you want it?	1753
Wrong number.	1753

There's nobody here.	1751
Africa.	1750
You're too kind.	1750
She's asleep.	1750

In what?	1750
You tell him.	1750

Put your hands on your head.	1743
Have a nice trip.	1742
Isn't it wonderful?	1742
This can't be.	1742
exactly.	1742
It's not okay.	1741
Carefully.	1741
She loves me.	1741
Get down on the ground!	1741
"Well	 go on."	1741
You can't be here.	1740
How's that sound?	1740
"No	 it won't."	1740
I gotta run.	1740
Kit!	1740
That's fair.	1740
He's not coming.	1739

Fine with me.	1724
Fire at will!	1724
I take it back.	1724

We'll talk.	1723
Come in here.	1723

It's a start.	1694
There it goes.	1693

It's a mistake.	1669
Good riddance.	1669

You fucking bitch!	1662
Jump in.	1661
Whose side are you on?	1661
Listen to you.	1661
Tell me now.	1661
What happened next?	1660
Run for it!	1660
"Hey	 Ray."	1660
It's insane.	1660
Abandon ship!	1660
Scissors.	1660
This is my life.	1659
Many times.	1659
I'm just asking.	1659
I'm not an idiot.	1659
Po!	1659
I don't care about that.	1659
I feel bad.	1658
Be calm.	1658
My job.	1658
Pepper.	1658
Cristina.	1658
"Good morning	 everyone."	1658
Count me in.	1658
Y eah.	1658
What are you writing?	1657
What do you want with me?	1657
"Hi	 girls."	1657
I'll teach you.	1657
"Thank you	"	1657
You asked for it.	1657
This isn't working.	1657
I don't love you.	1656
What did you tell them?	1656
You're not real.	1656
Give them to me.	1655
Fine by me.	1655
That reminds me.	1654
"Okay	 everybody."	1654
Counselor.	1654
Sonia!	1653
Are you asleep?	1653
So cool.	1652
You're a dead man.	1652
You're nothing.	1652
Cigarettes.	1652
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?	1651
V?	1651
Bon appÃ©tit.	1651
I'll give you that.	1651
I'll pay you back.	1651
That's what you said.	1651
"Hello	 Father."	1651
"No	 I couldn't."	1651
I thought you knew.	1650
That's not important.	1650
"Yes	 miss."	1650
Isn't that nice?	1649
That will be all.	1649
"Easy	 now."	1649
"There	 you see?"	1649
Who's with me?	1649
I'm so stupid.	1649
"No	 he isn't."	1649
That's all it is.	1649
Let me down!	1649
You with me?	1649
That's what we do.	1649
Come on over here.	1648
I got you something.	1648
How is it going?	1648
I found her.	1648
Heart attack.	1648
Don't tell me what to do.	1648
The war is over.	1648
Smooth.	1647
She's back.	1647
I fell.	1647
That's the whole point.	1647
I'm looking.	1646
"Uh	 hi."	1646
It's too bad.	1646
Need some help?	1646
Anyone home?	1646
You have the right to an attorney.	1646
I have to leave.	1646
You know this guy?	1645
Please continue.	1645
We'll be right there.	1645
Harriet.	1645
That's a lot.	1645
How did you find out?	1644
I don't feel so good.	1644
Gollum.	1644
Where's your mother?	1644
The ring.	1644
There's one.	1644
Don't be frightened.	1644
Loose!	1643
"Hey	 Tom."	1643
Killed?	1643
Take them off.	1643
Who's that guy?	1643
He's dangerous.	1643
A party?	1643
Turn it on.	1642
"It's okay	 honey."	1642
I wanted to tell you.	1642
Don't fucking move!	1642
I can't believe...	1642
Grrr!	1642
Open the gates!	1642
And one more thing.	1641
The dog.	1641
My favorite.	1641
Long live!	1641
I didn't do that.	1641
Can you feel it?	1641
Innocent?	1641
Radio.	1641
"Well	 don't worry."	1640
He is here.	1640
Vamos.	1639
Now then.	1639
Not well.	1639
What makes you so sure?	1638
Soldier!	1638
Got a light?	1638
"All right	 cool."	1638
Beat him!	1638
How much do you need?	1638
Where is he going?	1638
He's not there.	1638
This is nuts.	1638
Don't care.	1637
You don't have to say anything.	1637
He started it.	1637
Why wouldn't I?	1637
How interesting.	1637
Look what you did.	1636
Brandy.	1636
You didn't have to.	1636
"Okay	 go ahead."	1636
That's easy for you to say.	1636
"Hey	 what are you doing here?"	1636
You should know that.	1636
"Good evening	 ladies and gentlemen."	1635
I'll look into it.	1635
Just keep going.	1635
Just think.	1635
Sofia.	1635
She likes you.	1635
Fuck 'em.	1635
Marianne!	1635
But not you.	1634
"Yes	 fine."	1634
"Oh	 yeah	 yeah	 yeah."	1634
Will you come?	1633
No one else.	1633
That's what I'm doing.	1633
Come and sit down.	1633
What's she like?	1633
Where are your parents?	1632
Are you busy?	1632
Give me your hands.	1632
We just got here.	1632
College.	1631
Buck!	1631
Speak to me.	1630
I object!	1630
What did she do?	1630
Proof?	1630
No exceptions.	1630
Abraham.	1630
Trish.	1630
That too.	1629
I know you're there.	1629
That can't be right.	1629
Break a leg.	1629
Who is that guy?	1629
I need to tell you something.	1629
My hero.	1628
Half an hour.	1628
I'm not sure yet.	1628
You think this is funny?	1628
Bad dog!	1628
And so are you.	1627
"Run	 run!"	1627
That's my name.	1627
I don't know what I was thinking.	1627
Call the cops.	1627
Pippin!	1626
Things change.	1626
what happened?	1626
I saved your life.	1626
MOM!	1626
Help you?	1626
"Oh	 look at you."	1626
We're getting out of here.	1625
I had nothing to do with it.	1625
I agree with you.	1625
What happened to your hand?	1625
I can't go on.	1624
God help me.	1624
You want me?	1624
You need to leave.	1624
Why bother?	1623
"Hey	 excuse me."	1623
nothing.	1623
You want some coffee?	1623
I knew you would.	1623
That was weird.	1623
I will do it.	1622
Beep.	1622
See anything?	1622
He's the one.	1621
Gil.	1621
You should come.	1621
Who were they?	1621
I didn't do nothing.	1621
You have to leave.	1621
Let's try it.	1620
Far out.	1620
I have money.	1620
Around.	1620
Or worse.	1619
What are you doing down here?	1619
Behave.	1619
Where's my wife?	1619
Luis!	1619
She doesn't.	1619
How did I get here?	1618
I can't believe that.	1618
"Hey	 look at that."	1618
My hand!	1617
Marvellous.	1617
You know what I want.	1616
Get out here!	1616
Is that enough?	1616
Please stay.	1616
Joanna.	1615
Too soon?	1615
"You're joking	 right?"	1615
Tell me what you see.	1615
She's nice.	1615
"Okay	 Mom."	1615
Who does that?	1615
I can't see a thing.	1615
Whose is it?	1615
And him?	1614
What are you doing up?	1614
I need some help.	1614
Is that a threat?	1613
Does that hurt?	1613
You're afraid.	1613
Anita.	1613
It will be.	1613
Me first.	1613
Uh... no.	1613
What's with him?	1613
Did you find it?	1612
Good answer.	1612
I don't want anything.	1612
Have you forgotten?	1612
You're stupid.	1612
I would never do that.	1612
What do we know?	1611
Simple as that.	1611
Stop moving!	1611
She doesn't know.	1611
It's ours.	1611
That'd be nice.	1610
He was murdered.	1610
Find out.	1610
"Goodbye	 sir."	1610
I don't think you understand.	1610
Calvin.	1610
Edith.	1610
I found this.	1610
"Yeah	 she is."	1609
Yeah right.	1609
I'll leave.	1609
"No	 darling."	1609
Abe!	1609
Wolf!	1609
What did you get?	1609
"Oh	 Mom."	1608
That bitch!	1608
Don't follow me.	1608
You have no choice.	1608
"Hey	 Ben."	1607
"Here	 let me help you."	1607
Where's Dad?	1607
Keep your mouth shut.	1607
My office.	1606
You wanna come?	1606
"Well	 thank you very much."	1606
Take a breath.	1606
Sucker.	1606
I don't know how to thank you.	1606
The whole thing.	1606
What did I just say?	1606
I'm not angry.	1606
There's no such thing.	1605
Eight years.	1605
"I don't know	"	1605
Not necessary.	1605
Passport.	1605
Caitlin.	1605
"Now	 let's see."	1605
"Beautiful	 isn't it?"	1605
Hair.	1605
Get in line.	1604
Still nothing.	1604
"Thank you	 man."	1604
I fell asleep.	1604
So it's true.	1603
Kirk!	1603
I love...	1603
Milady.	1603
Then who?	1603
Afraid so.	1602
We need to get out of here.	1602
How'd you do it?	1602
I didn't see it.	1602
You're sick!	1602
Sons of bitches!	1602
Anything I can do?	1602
Straight up.	1601
WHAT'S GOING ON?	1601
"So	 what do we do now?"	1601
Shut it off!	1601
"Listen	 I..."	1601
We found it.	1601
Football.	1600
I just do.	1600
They're mine.	1600
Shocking.	1600
Very beautiful.	1600
"Uh	 well..."	1599
You want?	1599
I need more time.	1599
"I do	 too."	1598
Dynamite.	1598
Who are you working for?	1598
That man.	1598
"No	 that's..."	1598
What was?	1598
help me!	1598
"Oh	 my baby."	1598
Things have changed.	1597
Alvin!	1597
Cookie?	1597
Kira.	1597
I want to live.	1597
here.	1597
"Yeah	 I was."	1597
Mayor.	1597
I do now.	1597
Of course it does.	1596
Why would you think that?	1596
Sure you are.	1596
Peyton.	1595
I'm almost there.	1595
Is anybody there?	1595
This is a disaster.	1595
Partners.	1595
What's the trouble?	1595
Ellis.	1595
"Hey	 now."	1594
You want this?	1594
Thank you all for coming.	1594
I didn't mean to scare you.	1594
What the hell's wrong with you?	1594
What did you do to me?	1594
Was he?	1594
Which ones?	1594
Harris.	1594
Suction.	1594
I messed up.	1594
Marshal.	1593
It's a good idea.	1593
"No	 I'm all right."	1593
I want you to have it.	1592
There's nothing to talk about.	1592
We have to hurry.	1592
Allie.	1592
Knife.	1592
You called me.	1592
"No	 actually."	1592
Is someone there?	1591
Thinking.	1591
If that's what you want.	1590
Damien.	1590
I've got something for you.	1590
I don't wanna go.	1590
She can't.	1590
We're fucked.	1590
Lead the way.	1590
You were wrong.	1590
Maestro!	1590
Ty!	1590
But that's impossible.	1589
So what's up?	1589
You look fantastic.	1589
He was my friend.	1589
I'll call him.	1589
You betrayed me.	1589
Did you hear something?	1589
I can live with that.	1589
Allen!	1588
Are you feeling better?	1588
Uh-uh-uh.	1588
How do you know about that?	1588
"Now	"	1588
Did he say anything?	1588
It's not gonna work.	1588
Bon appetit.	1588
Judge.	1587
Flash.	1587
Can I say something?	1587
Come to bed.	1587
I don't know who that is.	1587
I'm right.	1587
And don't worry.	1587
What did you say to him?	1586
So this is it.	1586
Don't talk to me like that.	1586
Unacceptable.	1586
But I love you.	1586
That's hilarious.	1586
Why is he here?	1586
I LOVE YOU.	1586
But it's not.	1586
This way please.	1586
A joke.	1585
Are you in there?	1585
Do you believe me?	1585
Tessa!	1585
Can you keep a secret?	1585
Ditto.	1584
"Come on	 mate."	1584
sure.	1584
Pink.	1583
My face!	1583
Driver!	1583
Something's happening.	1583
You shouldn't have done that.	1583
I'm crazy.	1583
Willy.	1582
"Hello	 Dad."	1582
WAIT A MINUTE.	1582
Willow.	1582
I know I am.	1582
You need to go.	1582
Bond.	1582
What do you think I am?	1582
For this.	1581
Shall I?	1581
Night-night.	1581
"I know	 I'm sorry."	1581
"Come on	 Charlie."	1580
I thought we were friends.	1580
"Sit down	 sit down."	1580
We're all set.	1580
You scared the shit out of me.	1580
Cuff him.	1580
Nat!	1580
"Hey	 asshole!"	1580
Repeat after me.	1580
Nasty.	1580
Tails.	1580
I lied to you.	1580
You don't have a choice.	1580
Miriam.	1579
"Yes	 Mom."	1579
"Hell	 yes."	1579
Do you have children?	1579
"All right	 let's do it."	1578
Where are you taking him?	1578
It's not her.	1578
I don't even know you.	1578
You're a fool.	1578
"I'm sorry	 too."	1578
"Shh	 shh	 shh	 shh."	1578
What's the idea?	1578
"No	 forget it."	1577
Crane.	1577
That's all I want.	1577
Who are you guys?	1577
Company!	1577
He's drunk.	1577
Did you know about this?	1577
What was he like?	1577
You don't remember me?	1577
"Ooh	 ooh."	1577
Buckle up.	1577
He's coming back.	1577
Looks that way.	1577
Nailed it.	1576
There she goes.	1576
What does it do?	1576
Is this what you want?	1576
Do you live here?	1575
Aliens?	1575
We'll take it from here.	1575
Do tell.	1575
You think that's funny?	1575
Isn't he?	1574
The book.	1574
"Move it	 move it!"	1574
Fuck's sake.	1574
You be careful.	1573
You're full of shit.	1572
Throw it away.	1572
I've got this.	1572
She was here.	1572
You know what I'm sayin'?	1572
You look well.	1571
No pulse.	1571
What were you doing there?	1571
You don't belong here.	1571
You should have told me.	1570
"Oh	 I can't."	1570
That was a mistake.	1570
I don't feel like it.	1569
That's all I ask.	1569
Neither can I.	1569
"Hey	 Max."	1569
"Oh	 I almost forgot."	1568
He's leaving.	1568
How could this happen?	1568
I need money.	1568
Donny!	1568
It was wonderful.	1568
Not a bit.	1568
Bird.	1568
How are we doing?	1568
Please respond.	1567
"What the hell	 man?"	1567
I remember everything.	1566
"Go on	 get out of here."	1566
Trust you?	1566
What was she like?	1566
Toast.	1566
Dying.	1566
And here we are.	1565
Ten-hut!	1565
Disappeared.	1565
You look familiar.	1565
Present arms!	1564
Did they?	1564
"Yes	 father."	1564
My foot!	1564
Tristan!	1564
Thank you again.	1564
Hands behind your head.	1563
"Thank you	 baby."	1563
Split up.	1563
You'll like it.	1563
Jeannie.	1563
"Bye	 now."	1563
"Let's go	 man."	1563
Stay focused.	1562
Know what I'm saying?	1562
What'd I say?	1562
"Bye	 bye."	1562
"Oh	 is that right?"	1562
Heh-heh-heh.	1562
What do you want ?	1562
Thirty seconds.	1561
You're up early.	1561
Switch.	1561
"Oh	 that's it."	1561
Something is wrong.	1560
It's more than that.	1560
Comrades!	1560
None whatsoever.	1560
Sherry?	1560
aah!	1560
Morris.	1559
You choose.	1559
You know my name.	1559
I think so too.	1558
These things happen.	1558
Bon voyage.	1558
A date?	1557
Don't you remember me?	1557
"No	 it's not okay."	1557
"Yeah	 tell me about it."	1557
Without you.	1557
That was incredible.	1557
That's your job.	1556
It's not for me.	1556
I'll keep that in mind.	1556
Did you kill him?	1556
"Hey	 wait up!"	1556
How does it look?	1556
Every night.	1556
Party's over.	1555
You missed.	1555
Observe.	1555
I'm a writer.	1555
Tight.	1554
I like.	1554
I don't agree.	1554
Mimi!	1554
I want to see it.	1554
Marc.	1554
Golly.	1554
It's sad.	1553
I have to work.	1553
What the hell did you do?	1553
"Nice to meet you	 too."	1553
"Hey	 Jim."	1553
That was an accident.	1553
Maddie.	1552
What's the catch?	1552
So what do you want?	1552
Why did you stop?	1552
"Right	 okay."	1551
Am I dead?	1551
That's not what I'm saying.	1551
I'll protect you.	1551
"Very well	 thank you."	1551
"Uh	 I..."	1551
Don't flatter yourself.	1551
Tammy.	1551
That's what they say.	1550
And another thing.	1550
Mistress!	1550
Excuse.	1549
I didn't realize.	1549
Take it down.	1549
Going down.	1549
Sadie.	1549
Sabrina.	1549
This is him.	1549
Where did you hear that?	1548
Get some!	1548
It certainly is.	1548
What's what?	1548
You look different.	1548
I don't think I can.	1548
That woman.	1548
Let me have a look.	1548
Tequila.	1547
Is everything alright?	1547
I said shut up!	1547
Turn that off.	1547
You guys okay?	1547
What are you hiding?	1546
I like the sound of that.	1546
It was your idea.	1546
Lester.	1546
Go over there.	1546
It's free.	1546
Now I remember.	1546
What'd you find?	1545
Let's go together.	1545
"Oh	 I'm fine."	1545
Just so you know.	1545
We're out.	1544
We have a deal.	1544
What did I do wrong?	1544
Darcy.	1544
You don't even know me.	1544
I heard something.	1544
No question.	1544
You keep it.	1543
There you have it.	1543
"Well	 let's go."	1543
You are so beautiful.	1543
Possible.	1543
Look at these.	1543
You don't know her.	1542
It's now or never.	1542
As if.	1542
I look forward to it.	1542
That's a promise.	1542
I don't know what I'm doing.	1542
Washington.	1541
Shakespeare.	1541
Gail.	1541
Poppy!	1541
"Nice	 huh?"	1541
"Oh	 fuck me."	1540
I'm clean.	1540
What the hell's the matter with you?	1540
"Yes	 you were."	1540
You just did.	1540
Give me one.	1540
